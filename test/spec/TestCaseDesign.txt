# test cases to ensure we create correct restful services for AiR RESTFul Service
# How these test cases are developed:
# We just need to validate if express app has defined below url as "used".
# We are going to retrieve "app" from source code then validate its
# "used" properties.

# based on my rough design, we need to provide below services
#========= For Operator =================
# root html
# air/index.html

# search Test Card (by model number) or Result (by order number)
# search test card will return all match test cards.
# search result will return all available sessions associated with the order number.
# air/search?model=<model number>
# air/search?orderNumber=<order number>

# load Test Card by testCardId
# air/testCard/:testCardId
# this url supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.

# load result by order number and session key
# air/result/:orderNumber/:sessionKey
# this url supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.

#========== For Developer =================
# root html for developer
# air/develop/index.html

# url to get next available Test Card ID
# air/develop/newTestCardId?family=<family>&model=<model>&option=<option>
# this url supports GET

#========== For Release Administrator =====
# root page for administrator
# air/admin/index.html

# approve one Test Card release
# air/admin/release?testCardId=<test card id>

# upgrade class from C/D to A/B
# air/admin/approve?testCardId=<test card id>&currentClass=<current class>&approvedClass=<approved class>
